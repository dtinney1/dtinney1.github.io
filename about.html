            <p>I am a 18 year old High School senior currently attending Nordonia High School and Cyahoga Valley Career Center.  I am currently a chasier/stocker at GFS (Gordan Foods
            Service) I have been working there for a little of a year now.  I have experience bulding the physical aspects of computers and would like to say I am fairly knowlegable 
            in that feild.  Which is what made me want to be a programer so I can work on both ends of computers.  I got into computers because of video games which I enjoy during my 
            free time.   </p>
